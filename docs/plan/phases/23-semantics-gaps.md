# Phase 23 — Semantics gaps (decided 2026-10-07)

Five user-visible gaps russ decided to close after trying dcfs by hand and
reading README's limitations. All test first; owner dcfs-protocol unless
noted. Order: right after S3, before Phase 22 (cancellation) and Phase 13.

## 23.1 Writable mmap after the last close: reconcile on FORGET

With passthrough the mapping holds the backing file, so RELEASE arrives at
`close()` and later stores through the mapping bypass FUSE; the only later
request is FORGET. dcfs tracks which inodes had a writable open during
this run; on FORGET (and FORGET_MULTI) of such an inode it re-reads the
backing attributes by handle and reconciles size, mtime, ctime and
blocks (through the usual present/unknown rule), then drops the inode
from the set. Cost: one statx per such inode, only when the kernel lets
go. Not covered: a mapping that keeps writing for longer than the kernel
keeps the inode; that needs the kernel change (future work: the mapping
should keep the FUSE file referenced so RELEASE follows munmap).
Tests: guest test with a shared writable mmap written after close, then
`echo 2 > drop_caches` (FORGET), then a cold stat through dcfs must show
the new size/mtime (fails today); unit test with a forged FORGET; the
model gains nothing (attributes of child objects are outside it) but
trace validation must still pass with the new call site mapped as a
refresh.

## 23.2 Mutations on removed-but-referenced objects

Objects with no row (unlinked files still open, removed working
directories, O_PATH descriptors) are served from an in-memory record;
mutations fail with ESTALE because the three-phase protocol writes rows.
Make them work: setattr (truncate, chmod, chown, utimens), xattr set and
remove, and fsync apply through the object's open fd (dcfs holds one until
the last FORGET) and update the in-memory record with the backing's
result; the record carries its own tri-state so a crash mid-mutation
cannot leave a stale value (it is in memory: a crash loses it, which is
sound). Reopening an unlinked file through /proc/<pid>/fd stays as the
backing allows (open by handle of an nlink-0 inode works on ext4/xfs/
btrfs; verify). Tests: unlink-then-ftruncate/fchmod/fsetxattr on an open
file (fails today with ESTALE), chmod of a removed cwd, pjdfstest shards
still green.

## 23.3 relatime semantics for atime (dcfs-implementer)

Reads are passthrough, so dcfs never sees them. On OPEN of a regular file
for reading, update the cached atime to now if it is older than mtime or
ctime, or more than a day old (the kernel's `relatime` rule), and on the
backing's own timing if `strictatime`/`noatime` can be detected from the
mount (document). Record it in the cache only (the backing updates its
own atime on read); no backing I/O. Tests: cached atime after an open
follows the relatime rule; a second open within a day does not change it;
zero backing reads.

## 23.4 O_TMPFILE, copy_file_range, FICLONE/FICLONERANGE, ioctls

- `copy_file_range`: FUSE_COPY_FILE_RANGE, passthrough to
  `copy_file_range(2)` on the two backing fds, with the destination's
  three-phase bookkeeping (attributes unknown before, refreshed after).
- Reflinks: FUSE_IOCTL for FICLONE/FICLONERANGE/FIDEDUPERANGE forwarded to
  the backing fds (btrfs and xfs support them; ext4 returns EOPNOTSUPP);
  same bookkeeping. Other ioctls: forward a documented allowlist
  (FS_IOC_GETFLAGS/SETFLAGS, FS_IOC_FSGETXATTR/FSSETXATTR,
  FS_IOC_GETVERSION); everything else ENOTTY, listed in README.
- `O_TMPFILE`: FUSE_TMPFILE (libfuse `tmpfile` op): create an unnamed
  file in the backing directory with O_TMPFILE, served from an in-memory
  record like 23.2's; `linkat(AT_EMPTY_PATH)` into a name becomes a
  create-like mutation that gives it a row.
- Tests: `cp --reflink=always` on btrfs and xfs (fails today), `cp` using
  copy_file_range (coreutils does by default), `chattr +i`, O_TMPFILE +
  linkat; errno parity with the backing filesystem for each; coverage of
  the error paths through the failure-sweep harness (Phase 8 when it
  lands, else unit fakes now). Model: copy and clone are mutations of the
  destination object's attributes (outside the one-directory model);
  tmpfile+linkat is a create (`CreateArrive` with no probe): add it.

## 23.5 Boundary stubs now (pulled forward from Phase 15.4)

russ (2026-10-07): submounts and btrfs subvolumes must appear in readdir,
and anything inside them returns ENOTSUP (today: hidden, and EXDEV).
Implement Phase 15's decision 3 now: the persisted "refused" dentry is
served as a stub directory (mode/owner/times from the boundary root's
statx; nodeid from the reserved range at or above 2^63, which Phase 14
keeps; dcfs refuses backing inode numbers in that range from now on),
listed by readdir/readdirplus, lookup succeeds, anything inside returns
ENOTSUP with a one-time ERROR log, rename/link across it EXDEV. Keep
Phase 15.4's remaining items (the bind form's recorded mount points)
there. Tests: the Phase 15.1 stub tests, written now, failing today
(`ls` shows the subvolume, `ls sub/` gives ENOTSUP not EXDEV).

## 23.6 Held fd instead of a statx at FORGET (russ, 2026-10-07)

Replace 23.1's statx-by-handle at the last FORGET with an fd dcfs keeps
open for every file written during this run until that file's last
FORGET; the reconciliation then reads attributes through the held fd
(`fstatx`), which the kernel answers from the pinned inode without a
disk read, so a sleeping backing disk stays asleep. Cost: one fd per
written file until the kernel forgets it (bounded by the kernel's inode
cache, as the lookup map is); raise RLIMIT_NOFILE at startup and
document it.
**Document carefully, in three places that point at each other** (the
reason this exists and when to remove it):
- `docs/design.md`: passthrough mmap keeps only the backing file, so the
  kernel releases the dcfs file at `close()`, before `munmap`; stores
  through a mapping after the last close reach the backing file without
  a FUSE request; the last FORGET is the only later event, hence the
  reconciliation there, and the held fd keeps that reconciliation off the
  disk. The fix belongs in the kernel: a passthrough mapping should keep
  the FUSE file referenced so RELEASE follows `munmap`; once that lands
  (and the minimum kernel requires it), delete the written-file set, the
  held fds and the FORGET hook, and let the existing last-writable-
  release path cover mmap.
- the code: one marker comment (`// See design.md "mmap after close"
  (held-fd workaround)`) at the written-file set, the held fd and the
  FORGET hook, so a grep finds all three.
- `docs/plan/README.md` future work: the kernel change, with the pointer
  back to the workaround.
Tests: the 23.1 tests unchanged; plus the idle test extended with a
written-then-forgotten file (drop_caches) showing zero backing reads at
the FORGET (fails with 23.1's statx when the inode is cold: prove it with
a cold backing, e.g. after dropping the backing fs's caches via a second
drop or dm-delay timing).
